Simple Calculator using Test Driven Development exercise.

Acceptance Criteria - Conditions that the software must satisfy
- The calculator should be able to handle two numbers and one of the four
  basic operations add(+), subtract(-), multiply(*) and divide(/).
  Then be able to see the result of thouse two numbers and the operator.

 * * * Example * * *
 * input | output  * 
 * 10	 | 13      *
 * 3     |         *
 * +     |         *
 * * * * * * * * * *

Algorithm - logical thought process of the application
- First number = first user input
  If first number is not numeric then print warning
  Second number = second user input
  If second number is not numeric then print warning
  Operation = third user input 
  	If operation is + or "add" then
		Print first number + second number
	If operation is - or "subtract" then
		Print first number - second number
	If operation is * or "multiply" then
		Print frist number * second number
	If operation is / or "divide" then
		Print first number / second number
	else
		Print warning
